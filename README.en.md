# kiwoom-mcp-server

[한국어](README.md) · **English**

A **read-only** MCP server that exposes the Kiwoom Securities REST API.
From Claude Desktop / Claude Code you can query Korean stock quotes, charts,
order books, indices, rankings, and investor trends in natural language, along
with your account's balance, holdings, and transaction history. For an ISA
account it also computes your realized-gain aggregation against the tax-free
allowance.

> ⚠️ **Security notice**
>
> - Run this server **locally only** — never expose it to an external network.
> - The AppKey/AppSecret in `.env` grant real-account inquiry access. **Never
>   commit them** (`.env` is already in `.gitignore`).
> - Order execution (buy/sell/modify/cancel) is **excluded by design**. This
>   server never changes your account.

## Tools

**Market data** (account-independent — an app key is enough):

| Tool | Description | Kiwoom TR |
|---|---|---|
| `search_stock` | Name → code search (KOSPI/KOSDAQ, incl. ETF/ETN) | ka10099 |
| `get_stock_price` | Current price / change rate / volume / basic metrics | ka10001 |
| `get_stock_chart` | Daily/weekly/monthly/minute candles (adjusted price) | ka10080~83 |
| `get_orderbook` | 10-level ask/bid quotes and sizes | ka10004 |
| `get_market_index` | KOSPI/KOSDAQ composite and sector indices | ka20003 |
| `get_sector_price` | Sector index detail (breadth / 52-week range / intraday trend) | ka20001 |
| `get_sector_stocks` | Member stocks of a sector with quotes | ka20002 |
| `get_ranking` | Top gainers / losers / volume / trading value | ka10027/30/32 |
| `get_market_movers` | New highs / new lows / upper & lower limit / surges / plunges | ka10016/17/19 |
| `get_investor_trend` | Retail / foreign / institutional net-buy trend (period sum + daily) | ka10059, ka10061 |
| `get_etf_info` | ETF tracking index / tax type / quote / NAV & disparity | ka40002, ka10001, ka40009 |
| `get_etf_returns` | ETF period returns (1w/1m/6m/1y) vs a benchmark index | ka40001 |
| `get_short_selling` | Per-stock daily short-selling trend (short volume / weight / avg price) | ka10014 |
| `get_foreign_holding` | Per-stock foreign holding trend (holdings / holding weight / limit-usage rate) | ka10008 |

**Watchlist** (interest-stock groups saved in the 영웅문 HTS client — read-only):

| Tool | Description | Kiwoom TR |
|---|---|---|
| `get_watchlist_groups` | List of saved watchlist groups (code + name) | ka01300 |
| `get_watchlist` | Stocks in a group (enriched with name / prev close / market) | ka01301, ka10099 |

> The Kiwoom REST API exposes no watchlist **edit** (add/remove) TR — read-only.

**Theme**:

| Tool | Description | Kiwoom TR |
|---|---|---|
| `get_theme_groups` | Theme groups (change rate / stock count / period return / lead stocks; find a stock's themes) | ka90001 |
| `get_theme_stocks` | Member stocks of one theme with quotes (price / change / volume / period return) | ka90002 |

**Account** (scoped to the account bound to the app key):

| Tool | Description | Kiwoom TR |
|---|---|---|
| `get_account_balance` | Deposit + total valuation / total P&L / estimated deposit assets | kt00001, kt00018 |
| `get_account_holdings` | Per-holding quantity / average cost / current price / valuation P&L | kt00018 |
| `get_transactions` | Transaction history for a period (trade date, unit price, settlement amount) | kt00015 |
| `get_pending_orders` | Open/unfilled orders (order no., side, status, ordered/unfilled qty, price) | ka10075 |
| `get_trading_journal` | The day's trading journal (per-stock buy/sell avg price, qty, realized P&L, totals) | ka10170 |
| `calc_isa_tax_status` | ISA aggregated net gain vs. the tax-free allowance (realized + full-liquidation scenario) | kt00015, ka10074, kt00018 |

Plus `ping` (connectivity check, no app key needed). Every response is prefixed
with `[모의투자]` (VIRTUAL) / `[실전투자]` (REAL) so you can tell which server
answered. The first `search_stock` call downloads the stock master (~4,300
symbols), takes a few seconds, and is then cached for 12 hours.

### Notes on `calc_isa_tax_status`

- Aggregation start date: `ISA_OPENED_ON` (account opening date) in `.env` is the
  default; override per call with `from_date`.
- If dividends/distributions are not auto-detected from the transaction history,
  enter them manually via the `dividends_received` argument.
- A stock's tax type (taxable vs. domestic-equity) is classified automatically —
  for ETFs from Kiwoom's own `etftxon_type` (ka40002), otherwise by a name-based
  heuristic. Correct a wrong classification with
  `overrides: [{stock_code, tax_type}]`. Results are for reference only — actual
  taxation follows the broker's settlement.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20.12 or later** (uses `process.loadEnvFile`)
- A Kiwoom Securities REST API app key — register an app at the
  [Kiwoom Open API portal](https://openapi.kiwoom.com) to obtain one.
  - VIRTUAL (paper trading) and REAL use **separately issued app keys**; the key
    type must match `KIWOOM_MODE`.
  - The account is bound to the app key, so no account number is required.

## Install

The package is published to npm, so you can **run it with `npx` — no clone
required**; just use the npx config in "Connecting Claude Desktop" / "Connecting
Claude Code" below. In that case you pass your app key via the **client config's
`env` block** instead of a `.env` file (examples in each connection section).

To build from source or modify the code:

```sh
git clone <this repo URL>    # or copy the source
cd kiwoom-mcp-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env         # fill in the values per the table below
npm run build                # produces dist/
npm test                     # unit tests (no network required)
```

## Environment variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `KIWOOM_APP_KEY` | ✅ | Kiwoom REST API app key |
| `KIWOOM_APP_SECRET` | ✅ | Kiwoom REST API app secret |
| `KIWOOM_MODE` | | `VIRTUAL` (paper trading, default) or `REAL` (live trading) |
| `ISA_ENABLED` | | `true` registers the `calc_isa_tax_status` tool. Default `false` (general-account-first) |
| `ISA_TYPE` | | `GENERAL` (general, 2,000,000 KRW limit, default) or `SEOMIN` (low-income/farmer-fisher, 4,000,000 KRW). Only used when `ISA_ENABLED=true` |
| `ISA_OPENED_ON` | | ISA account opening date `yyyy-MM-dd` — default aggregation start for `calc_isa_tax_status`. Only used when `ISA_ENABLED=true` |

The default is **general-account-first**: without extra config, only the market-data
and account-inquiry tools are exposed. To use the tax-free-limit tool on an ISA
account, set `ISA_ENABLED=true` and fill in `ISA_TYPE`/`ISA_OPENED_ON`. When off,
`calc_isa_tax_status` is not registered and every other tool still works.

`.env` is resolved from the project root first, so the server works even when
launched from an arbitrary working directory (as Claude Desktop does).

## Connecting Claude Desktop

Config file location:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**npx (published) — no clone; pass your app key via the `env` block:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kiwoom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "kiwoom-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "KIWOOM_APP_KEY": "…",
        "KIWOOM_APP_SECRET": "…",
        "KIWOOM_MODE": "REAL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**From source — run `dist/index.js` directly; app key from the project-root `.env`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kiwoom": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/kiwoom-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Prefer the absolute path to the executable** (find it with `which node` or
> `which npx`). GUI apps do not inherit your shell `PATH`, so a bare `"node"` /
> `"npx"` can make the server silently fail to start — the single most common
> failure.

After saving, fully quit Claude Desktop (⌘Q on macOS) and relaunch to see the
tools. **After every `npm run build` rebuild you must fully quit and relaunch
again** for the change to take effect.

## Connecting Claude Code

npx (published) — pass your app key via `-e` flags:

```sh
claude mcp add kiwoom \
  -e KIWOOM_APP_KEY=… -e KIWOOM_APP_SECRET=… -e KIWOOM_MODE=REAL \
  -- npx -y kiwoom-mcp-server
```

From source — app key from the project-root `.env`:

```sh
claude mcp add kiwoom -- node /absolute/path/kiwoom-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

## Smoke test

You can verify over stdio without an MCP client:

```sh
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"t","version":"0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ping","arguments":{}}}' \
  | node dist/index.js
```

`ping` responds without a `.env`. Market-data and account tools need an app key.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Tools don't appear in Desktop | Is `command` an **absolute** node path? Did you run `npm run build`? Did you fully quit and relaunch Desktop? |
| `환경설정이 없거나 잘못되었습니다` (config missing/invalid) | Is `.env` in the project root, with the required variables filled in? |
| `키움 인증에 실패했습니다` (auth failed) | Does the app-key type (paper/live) match `KIWOOM_MODE`? Is the app active on the portal? |
| `요청 한도를 초과했습니다` (rate limit) | Kiwoom rate limit (~1 req/s per TR). This means it was still exceeded after the server's automatic retry — wait a moment and retry. |
| Deposit differs from the D+2 estimated deposit | Normal when there are unsettled (D+2) trades. |

## Development

```sh
npm run dev        # run the source directly with tsx
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # vitest
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
```

Structure: `src/kiwoom/` (auth / HTTP / TR layer) → `src/tools/` (MCP tools with
formatters split out) → `src/isa/` (tax-type classification / realized-P&L
reconstruction / gain aggregation). See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed rules and the
verified API contract.
